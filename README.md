# ðŸ¦… AlgoHawks â€” Public Crypto Analysis

**Welcome to AlgoHawks Public Crypto Analysis**  
An open, research-first exploration of cryptocurrency market structure, relationships, and statistical patterns. This repository is a continuation of my graduate-level research project, designed to be **transparent, reproducible, and extensible**.

---

## ðŸ“… Latest Updates
- **2025-08** â€” Added two core datasets:
  - `asset_metadata_master.csv` â€” structured metadata for **310 cryptocurrencies**  
  - `research_ohlcv_1d_compact.parquet` â€” 1D OHLCV research data for the same 310 assets
- All data aligned for analysis and compressed for efficient storage.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Scope
- In-depth market structure and cross-asset correlation analysis  
- Sector, category, and blockchain family mapping  
- Volatility regime segmentation and rolling correlation stability metrics  
- Fully documented Jupyter notebooks with inline figures  
- Open to **non-investment collaborations** for dataset curation and exploratory analysis

## ðŸ’¬ How You Can Contribute
We welcome contributions from data engineers to crypto enthusiasts. Hereâ€™s how you can help:

### ðŸ”¹ **Data Contributions**
- **Add new cryptocurrencies** â€” must be present in both:
  - `asset_metadata_master.csv`
  - `research_ohlcv_1d_compact.parquet`
- **Remove unlisted/delisted assets** â€” remove from both files.
- **Extend history** â€” add OHLCV data for:
  - Newer periods since last pull
  - Older historical data
  - Filling existing gaps for current assets
- **Confirm & update classifications**:
  - `categories` (main sectors)
  - `market_cap` â€” ensure values are correct and `market_cap_rank` is **sorted correctly**
  - `market_cap_tier` â€” consistent with updated ranks
  - **Families** (`crypto_family`, `family_list`)
- **Important** â€” The `consolidated_categories_list` and `consolidated_categories` fields, as well as family aggregations, are **generated by a special aggregation function** â€” you do **not** need to manually change them unless you are updating the underlying base categories/families.

ðŸ“Œ **Formatting Rules**:
- Keep the **exact column order and file format** for `asset_metadata_master.csv`
- For `research_ohlcv_1d_compact.parquet`, maintain the same compression (zstd) and schema
- No extra columns, renames, or dropped required fields

### ðŸ”¹ **Analysis & Exploration**
- Suggest and implement new market structure metrics
- Explore alternative clustering/grouping logic
- Create visualizations for niche crypto sectors or themes
